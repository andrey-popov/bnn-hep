/**
 * \brief Performs "gaussianisation" of the input variables.
 * 
 * Transfroms the input variables in order to make thier distributions be Gaussian (each variable is
 * considered independently). The initial distributions are expected to be continuous. The program
 * does not fail otherwise but the resulted distributions will not be Gaussian. The transformation
 * is taken from TMVA users' guide.
 * 
 * Cumulative distribution needed for the transformation is calculated with the help of Boost
 * accumulators. Additionally quantiles implemented in the same package are used to determine the
 * range for each variable. However the range boundaries are merely added as two additional points,
 * all the calculated points in CDF (also those falling outside the range) are kept. CDF is
 * interpolated linearly.
