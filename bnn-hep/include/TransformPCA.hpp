 * \brief Performs principal component analysis (PCA).
 * 
 * Performs principal component analysis (PCA).
 * 
 * ROOT implementation of PCA through TPrincipal class does not handle weighted events. One can
 * reimplement this class adding weights in the calculation of the covariance matrix or implement
 * decorrelation of the input variables (Ã  la TMVA) by hands. In the latter case ROOT class
 * TMatrixDSymEigen and TMVA class VariableDecorrTransform might be useful.
 * 
 * The transformation is switched off at the moment.
